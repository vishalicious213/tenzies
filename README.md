# TENZIES

- Used the 2nd parameter in the .map() method (the index of the array item) as the ID for each die being rendered by \<Die /> instead of `nanoid`
- Styled \<Die /> using conditional rendering and CSS classes instead of an object with inline styles

Additional features:

- Showing number of rolls, per game
- Showing time in seconds, per game
